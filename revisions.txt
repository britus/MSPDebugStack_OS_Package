Rev 3.2.1.009
========================================================================

   !NOTE this an all new DLL design!
   The DLL version 3.2.1.9 is an all new DLL design compared to
   the last DLL version 2.9.4.1. This new DLL includes also a new
   UIF-Firmware. Furthermore the USB driver has been changed to a
   certified CDC driver.
   The DLL is implemented in C++ and follows a object base
   design, which is host operating system independent .
   The API of the new DLL is the same as for the old one.
   DLL functionality keeps the same as in the old V2 DLL.
   The new DLL V3 also includes a compiled version of the DLL v2.
   For more details please see www.ti.com/mspds

   The new CDC drivers and other imported information about the new UIF
   firmware update could be found in MSP430_DLL_Devopers guide, which
   is part of this packet.
